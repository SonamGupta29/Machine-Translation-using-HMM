    Code mixed NL Generation

The most natural form of language that we come across theses day is come mixed. Especially in a country like India majority of the population is bilingual. The phenomenon of code mixing often  occurs on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Whatsapp.

When keenly observed, the code mixing is not random at all. Patterns can be observed.

Given code mixed data, using LM, PCFG and PCYK, sentence generation should be the bare minimum for this projects. Improvisation of the sentence quality by incorporating creative methods for NLG will be rewarded.

Question : CFGs are not the best representation for parsing free word order languages we need to work with dependency grammars.
